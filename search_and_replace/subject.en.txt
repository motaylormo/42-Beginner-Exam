Write a program called search_and_replace that takes 3 arguments, the first 
arguments is a string in which to replace a letter (2nd argument) by
another one (3rd argument).

If the number of arguments is not 3, just display a newline.

If the second argument is not contained in the first one (the string)
then the program simply rewrites the string followed by a newline.

Examples:
$>./search_and_replace "My life for Aizr" "z" "u"
My life for Aiur
$>./search_and_replace "gaetan" "art" "zul" | cat -e
